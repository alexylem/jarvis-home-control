## Description
If your home automation system can be controlled via http requests, this Jarvis plugin is just for you.
It will allow you to simply turn on and off your devices.

## Configuration

1. Indicate the turn on and turn off http urls (with `[ADDRESS]` placeholder):
   
   ```
   pg_hc_turnon_url="http://192.168.1.1/home.php?action=on&device=[ADDRESS]"
   pg_hc_turnoff_url="http://192.168.1.1/home.php?action=off&device=[ADDRESS]"
   ```
   
2. List your device names & corresponding addresses in `json` format
   
   ```
   pg_hc_config='{ "devices":[
       { "name": "BEDROOM", "address": "A1"},
       { "name": "LIVING ROOM", "address": "A2"},
       { "name": "BAR", "address": "A3"}
   ]}'
   ```
